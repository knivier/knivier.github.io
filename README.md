# Knivier Web
## A simple web portfolio that works
Welcome to the `readme.md` of my portfolio website!

### This website is now 100% mine
I previously used a template design, however as I continued to build upon it, it got too complex. Loading times were often significant and this made me refactor the entire website.

The new website is (in my opinion) much more beautiful, faster and represents my work much better. All rights reserved; see licensing info more more details. 

10/25 Release Note Improvements
- Manually built frameworks in HTML, CSS and JS with no images
- Lightning fast responsiveness
- Smooth scrolling for a more *smooth* experience
- Faster GitHub redirect; 1.5sec instead of 3sec
- Manually adjusted animations to make it easy to run from potato to super computers
- More personalized adjustments and achievements deck

- Project history pane has hidden backlinks to all the projects
- Front page shows "Contact Me" (brings to improved Contact Pane) and my GitHub (redirect: see github.html out of src 

Update 2: 
Hello all! This is the updated version of my website which includes a lot more information. This is pretty much the HQ of all my projects.

How is this site categorized?
Well...
- Main Page: This is index.html and is the "root" for all my projects to stem out to. 
- Activerse: This is for my 2D java game engine: Activerseinfo is the main "activerse" page, followed by actvisions which is a version log site
- Popcorn: This include popcorn.html and aboutpopcorn.html, which are for my metal kernel framework projects.
- Troll Game: This is on trollgameinfo.html and may be taken down and moved to a different website; troll game has been discontinued
- Count down: This is for my schools holidays that are upcoming
