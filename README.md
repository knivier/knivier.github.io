# Knivier Web
## A simple web portfolio that works
Welcome to the `readme.md` of my portfolio website!

### This website is now 100% mine
I previously used a template design, however as I continued to build upon it, it got too complex. Loading times were often significant and this made me refactor the entire website.

The new website is (in my opinion) much more beautiful, faster and represents my work much better. All rights reserved; see licensing info more more details.
