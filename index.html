            <p>This is my portfolio or informatics page, where you can find lots of information about me. I decided not
                to go with a regular site hoster, so this website has been created
                under a template from HTML5Up, but heavily modified for my purpose. If you want to see my custom
                websites that I did build, you can find them
                in the work section.</p>

            <span class="image main"><img alt="" src="src/images/aboutmePic.png"/></span>
            <p>Hello, I'm Agniva, or known online as Knivier. I'm a 15-year-old High School Junior that also loves to
                code, play tennis, and learn interesting things. You won't find my CV or resumes here due to privacy
                reasons. However, if you're a company or organisation that wants to reach out for my resumes, you can
                contact me!</p>
            <p>My primary activity is coding, which will be dominantly featured on here. I've also gone to some
                competitions during the 2023:24 school year, which include MSU, EMU (8<sup>th</sup> place), and SVSU.
                The 2023:24 year is also where
                I became the Vice President of my High School's coding club, and this 2024:25 year I have become the
                full president! My
                experience is as follows: </p>
            <ul class="skills-list">
                <li>
                    <span>Web Design: 3 Years of using HTML & CSS</span>
                    <div class="details">
                        <p>I first started with HTML & CSS for my coding journey. Even though they weren't "true"
                            programming languages, I still enjoyed coding websites. To further
                            my skills and gain more experience, I took Web Design I at my High School but felt the class
                            was more limiting, and it's teaching methods were more constrictive. That's why
                            I started learning more skills from W3Schools, and other online websites that allowed me to
                            modify website templates and make cooler websites! </p>

                    <div class="details">
                        <p>My first true programming language was Python, but I quickly hated the syntax and feel of the
                            language. I've developed few projects using the language, and I still try
                    </div>

                <li>
                    <span>Java: My primary coding language with ~1.5 years of experience</span>
                    <div class="details">
                        <p>My interest in Java started with the video game "Minecraft" and I really started building my
                            knowledge learning how to mod the game and use plugins.
                            I wanted to increase my knowledge in the language, and took AP-Computer Science: A. From
                            there, it's become my current favourite programming language, and I've
                            developed some basic and intermediate projects using it!</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm also always interested in learning new programming languages. My current coding goals include
                advancing my Java knowledge even farther, and having an intermediate level of knowledge in
                JavaScript.</p>

            <span class="image main"><img alt="" src="src/images/workpic.png"/></span>
            <p>This part of my website is a compilation of my works from too much free-time, to class projects I deeply
                admire.
                Some of my work is updated, other parts are not. When citing my work or using it for alternative
                purposes, please
                make sure to credit me and (especially when using following code) follow license guidelines.</p>

                    <h3><a href="activerseinfo.html">Activerse</a></h3>
                    <p>My biggest project to date as of right now, Activerse is a Java-based game engine meant to help
                        people create
                        games by simplifying the GUI experience. I was inspired by Greenfoot but annoyed from the lack
                        of customization and descriptions regarding
                        how Greenfoot initially worked, and I wanted a more customizable version of which I could modify
                        the source code. From a library to engine, this is
                        my biggest project to date. For more information on how to use this project, you can check out
                        the Wiki which has all the quick start guides you'll need.</p>

                    <p>Troll Game is a simple text-based game that uses logic and lots of randomization to make each
                        play seem different from the previous. I created
                        this game for my AP-CSA midterm, and I've tried to keep it alive to this day! While updates are
                        on the slower slide, it's still a well polished game that can
                        be entertaining (depending on your genre type). </p>
