            <p>Hello, I'm Agniva, or known online as Knivier (socials via AtomicKniv). I'm a 15-year-old High School
                Junior that also loves to
                code, play tennis, and learn interesting things. You won't find my CV or resumes here due to privacy
                reasons. However, if you're a company or organisation that wants to reach out for my resumes, you can
                <a href="#contact">contact me</a> via any of my socials or email.</p>
            <p>My primary activity is coding, which will be dominantly featured on here. I've also gone to some
                competitions during the 2023:24 school year, which include MSU, EMU (8<sup>th</sup> place), and SVSU.
                The 2023:24 year is also where
                I became the Vice President of my High School's coding club, and this 2024:25 year I have become the
                full president! You can check the archives for that right here: <a href="pihicompsci-archives.html" target="_blank">Click Here!</a>
                My coding experience is as follows: </p>
            <ul class="skills-list">
                <li>
                    <span>Web Design: 3 Years of using HTML & CSS</span>
                    <div class="details">
                        <p>I first started with HTML & CSS for my coding journey. Even though they weren't "true"
                            programming languages, I still enjoyed coding websites. To further
                            my skills and gain more experience, I took Web Design I at my High School but felt the class
                            was more limiting, and it's teaching methods were more constrictive. That's why
                            I started learning more skills from W3Schools, and other online websites that allowed me to
                            modify website templates and make cooler websites! </p>
                    </div>

                <li>
                    <span>Python: Around 1-2 years of basic experience and knowledge via Python</span>
                    <div class="details">
                        <p>My first true programming language was Python, but I quickly hated the syntax and feel of the
                            language. I've developed few projects using the language, and I still try to develop in the
                            language.
                            Most of my Python work includes using Discord.py, but I've also been part of a research
                            study partnered
                            with the University of Michigan's 'Girls Who Code' at my High School coding club (current
                            President).

                <li>
                    <span>Java: My primary coding language with ~1.5 years of experience</span>
                    <div class="details">
                        <p>My interest in Java started with the video game "Minecraft" and I really started building my
                            knowledge learning how to mod the game and use plugins.
                            I wanted to increase my knowledge in the language, and took AP-Computer Science: A. From
                            there, it's become my current favourite programming language, and I've
                            developed some basic and intermediate projects using it!</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm also always interested in learning new programming languages. My current coding goals include
                advancing my Java knowledge even farther, and having an intermediate level of knowledge in
                JavaScript.</p>

            <span class="image main"><img alt="" src="src/images/work-header.png"/></span>
            <p>This part of my website is a compilation of my works from too much free-time, to class projects I deeply
                admire.
                Some of my work is updated, other parts are not. When citing my work or using it for alternative
                purposes, please
                make sure to credit me and (especially when using following code) follow license guidelines.</p>

                    <p>My biggest project to date as of right now, Activerse is a Java-based game engine meant to help
                        people create
                        games by simplifying the GUI experience. I was inspired by Greenfoot but annoyed from the lack
                        of customization and descriptions regarding
                        how Greenfoot initially worked, and I wanted a more customizable version of which I could modify
                        the source code. From a library to engine, this is
                        my biggest project to date. For more information on how to use this project, you can check out
                        the Wiki which has all the quick start guides you'll need.</p>

                    <p>Troll Game is a simple text-based game that uses logic and lots of randomization to make each
                        play seem different from the previous. I created
                        this game for my AP-CSA midterm, and I've tried to keep it alive to this day! While updates are
                        on the slower slide, it's still a well polished game that can
                        be entertaining (depending on your genre type). </p>

                    <h3>Pal - Python</h3>
                    <p>Pal is a simple Discord bot that's used as a template to create other things. I originally
                        created it
                        in 2020 during COVIDs reign with the help of a friend. However, since then, it's become a much
                        more customizable
                        Discord bot that helped me see how Python's syntax and usability was.
                        The project is updated on a much slower pace because Python isn't my primary (nor favourite)
                        language.</p>
