        <h2>From the Creator</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Knivier! I'm the solo developer behind Troll Game, created in January 2024. This project has been sunsetted
        as of 7/18/2024 and will only receive updates for bugs and/or security purposes.<br>Troll game was never meant to be
        the project I always worked on, it was simply a hobby to kill time. Text-based games are unpopular and rather difficult to show
        off as an achievement, and the code is not at my level anymore. I don't have the time to update the project with new features, because
        my priorities are elsewhere. Feel free to add onto what I could not, in this still awesome text-based game.<br>Thank you to all those
        who tested my game in my AP-CSA class, my friends, my teacher, and at most people on Discord for bug fixes and feature ideas. <br>YOU MUST STILL adhere to license guidelines.</p>

        <h3>The Game</h3>
        <p>Troll Game puts you in charge of leading the trolls, engaged in an eternal battle against Archie the Dragon.
            Choose between Ranked Mode for quick gameplay focused on earning money, or Adventure Mode (in progress) for
            a deeper dive into the game mechanics.</p>

        <h3>How to Get Playing?</h3>
        <p>To start playing, download the JAR file and ensure you have Java JDK 17 or higher installed. Optionally, use
