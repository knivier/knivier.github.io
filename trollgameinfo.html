        <h2>From the Creator</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Knivier! I'm the solo developer behind Troll Game, created in January 2024. This project has been sunsetted
        as of 7/18/2024 and will only receive updates for bugs and/or security purposes.<br>Troll game was never meant to be
        the project I always worked on, it was simply a hobby to kill time. Text-based games are unpopular and rather difficult to show
        off as an achievement, and the code is not at my level anymore. I don't have the time to update the project with new features, because
        my priorities are elsewhere. Feel free to add onto what I could not, in this still awesome text-based game.<br>Thank you to all those
        who tested my game in my AP-CSA class, my friends, my teacher, and at most people on Discord for bug fixes and feature ideas. <br>YOU MUST STILL adhere to license guidelines.</p>

        <h3>The Game</h3>
        <p>Troll Game puts you in charge of leading the trolls, engaged in an eternal battle against Archie the Dragon.

            a deeper dive into the game mechanics.</p>

        <h3>How to Get Playing?</h3>
        <p>To start playing, download the JAR file and ensure you have Java JDK 17 or higher installed. Optionally, use
